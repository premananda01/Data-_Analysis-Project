I have undertaken a data analytics project focusing on the career statistics of one of India's greatest cricket players, Virat Kohli. Utilizing Excel for data organization and Power BI for visualization, I created an interactive dashboard that offers a comprehensive analysis of Kohli's performance. This dashboard provides users with an engaging and intuitive way to explore various aspects of his career statistics, including batting averages, strike rates, and performance across different formats and venues. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate the power of data analytics in sports and the insights that can be derived from well-visualized data
